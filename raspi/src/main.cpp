/*
* Driver used to run WebSid as a native program on a RaspberryPi4 to drive 
* a SidBerry mounted SID chip.
*
* Note: the WebSid emulator uses:
* 
* NTSC:	59.8260895 Hz screen refresh rate 
* 		17095 clock cycles per frame
* 		1022727 Hz clock speed (14.31818MHz/14)
* 		
* PAL:	50.124542  Hz screen refresh rate 
* 		19656 clock cycles per frame
* 		985249 Hz clock speed (17.734475MHz/18)
* 
* Known Limitation: due to different clock speeds, the speed of a "cycle" would 
* normally differ between NTSC and PAL but the used "SidBerry" device always uses 
* the same clock speed of 1MHz, i.e. the WF output calculated by the emulation will
* inevitably get out of sync with the 1MHz clocked real SID chip.. todo: it might be a 
* good idea to save the "script" files and later re-run a 1Mhz clocked SID emulation
* directly based on that script file - and use that for comparisons.
* 
* Issue #2: The timestamps recorded in the emulation are measured using the correct
* clockspeed of the song's specified environment (NTSC vs PAL). Whereas the playback
* thread uses the (flawed) 1MHz counter of the Raspberry (which probably is NOT in 
* sync with the real 1MHz crystal used on the device either.).

/*
	ISSUE: it seems the Linux scheduler disrupts the timing with some kind of interrupt that occurs 
	with a 100Hz frequency: introducing average delays of ~7 micros (but which may occasionally 
	peak up to 30 micros).
	
	For regular songs that just expect some register update every 20ms these glitches are 
	irrelevant as long as the register is eventually updated. However these songs would be 
	massively hurt if affected updates went missing (i.e. bad idea to drop delayed writes).

	However there are songs that depend on very accurately timed, fast paced SID writes that
	are typically performed via an NMI. They try to exploit one of several SID effects that 
	all depend on very exact timing:
	The "distance" between SID writes will "normally" be at least 4 cycles - see 6510's 
	"STA/STX/STY instructions" available for writing to SID (so under normal conditions there
	should be plenty of time to correctly perform them in the player - but not then the logic
	is interrupted for several micros :-( ). Delays may hurt respective songs either due to 
	some SID state not being turned on long enough or to it being turned on for too long.
	
	(There are READ_MODIFY_WRITE operations that will trigger even faster SID write 
	sequences - but these are NOT currently triggered in WebSid and they are very rarely 
	used - Soundcheck.sid is one of the exceptions that might be affected.) 
	
	Below an example of a typical digi-player (see LMan - Vortex.sid), where a 4-writes 
	sequence is performed within a 20 micros interval. The routine plays samples at about 
	8kHz, i.e. it runs in a loop that is repeated every ~125 clock cycles:
	
	;2257    A2 11       LDX #$11          TRIANGLE + GATE(i.e. start "attack phase") 
	;2259    8E 12 D4    STX $D412  +0
	;225C    A2 09       LDX #$09		   TEST (i.e. reset phase accu at 0) + GATE ; i.e. no 	
	                                       waveform means that current DAC level is sustained
	;225E    8E 12 D4    STX $D412	+6
	;2261    AE 08 04    LDX $0408
	;2264    8E 0F D4    STX $D40F	+14    set frequency of oscillator for targeted sample output level
	;2267    A2 01       LDX #$01          GATE (i.e. removal of TEST starts the counting 
	                                       in phase accu)
	;2269    8E 12 D4    STX $D412	+20    "start seeking", i.e. "seek for the desired output 
	                                       level" - this state will stay for ~100 clocks before 
										   the above code is restarted

	(see https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:vicious_sid_demo_routine_explained )
										   
	The actual output level is played at ;225E, i.e. whatever state the SID has been
	skillfully manouvered into at this point defines what is output for the next 125 clock 
	cycles - the remaining logic just makes sure to end up in the correct state: The concept 
	is to select a specific output level (see ;2264) using a triangle waveform (i.e. a waveform
	that linearly changes from minimum to maximum output level - a saw waveform 
	could be used just as well) by letting the oscillator count for an exact(!) period of 
	time (i.e. counting starts from 0 with the write at ;2269 and stops with write at ;225E). 
	Counting for too long or not long enough always results in an incorrect output 
	level. Here it is crucial that the duration that the TEST bit has been set is correct to 
	the cycle!
	
	Half of this problem could be compensated for by a hack: If a delay is observed during 
	a write that clears the TEST bit, then the next write that sets the TEST bit could just 
	be delayed by the same amount. However, if the delay strikes in the second write, nothing
	can be done since the SIDs oscillator has already counted too far.. which cannot be 
	undone. Additionally, in the short period between where the actual waveform is turned on
	(see ;2259) to where it is "frozen" (;225E) a delay might still have some effect.
