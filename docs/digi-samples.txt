concerning SID digi samples
---------------------------

To get into the mood for the subject matter, you might want to head 
over to my online playlist in DeepSID first, to have a listen to respective
SID digi sample music:

The MOS SID chips were not designed to directly replay recorded audio 
samples and the small amount of RAM available on the C64 severely limits
the amount and/or quality of sampled data that can be used under the 
best of circumstances. 

Obviously that sounds exactly like the kind of challenge that C64 geeks
would just be too happy to accept.


The memory limitations mean that the total playback length of sampled
data is typically limited to a few seconds and to make the most of it, 
respective sequences are usually used for reusable instruments. But 
people have also searched ways around the RAM limitation, e.g. by 
reloading data from secondary storage during playback (see 
Wonderland XIII: https://youtu.be/bIM4p0uL6Pw?t=452 ) or by abusing 
built-in ROM code as a sample data replacement (see 
Acid_Flashback.sid ). 


The below will look into the different techniques that have been 
used to trick the SID chip into then actually play random audio samples. 
The respective techniques are all more or less timing sensitive and 
usually the newer, higher quality techniques differ from the older,
lower quality implementations by now well they manage to control
cycle exact timing (which, depending on the available timing disturbances,
is a challenge in its own right - see clock cycles abducted by the VIC-II 
chip used for sprites and text lines, or the suitable synchronisation of
general purpose CIA timers with respective "screen refresh" specific 
timings; example: Immigrant_Song.sid).

There are basically 4 general approaches:

- $d418 "volume register" based 
- frequency modulation based
- pulse waveform based
- waveform toggling based



1) $d418 "volume register" based

This is probably the oldest technique: The SID's audio output is directly 
modulated by changing the master volume. The result of this approach 
primarily depends on the original output available for modulation, i.e. 
ideally the original output would need to be at a constant maximum which 
would then allow the technique to modulate it to "anything" 
between 0 and that maximum. A flaw in the old 6581 SIDs made them
particularly suceptible to this exploit: respective chips always produce 
some kind of output voltage offset which means that there is always "some" 
kind of original signal that can be modulated via the master volume -
even when there is no regular voice output.

The advantage of this approach is the fast execution speed, since it
only requires one register-write (i.e. 4-clock cycles) to output a sample.

A disadvantage of the approach is that the quality of the digi-signal
will usually suffer when the SID's voices are already producing 
regular waveform output (it will just modulate whatever the current
output level might be).

Another limitation of this approach is that by hacking into the last 
stage of the audio output generation, the filter does not affect the 
respective digi-signal.

Also the volume part of the D418 register is 4-bits - which limits the 
resolution of individual samples accordingly. 


	example songs: Arkanoid.sid, Arcade_Classics.sid
	(ps: use https://deepsid.chordian.net/ to play the songs online)

However this technique usually works poorly on the newer 8580 SID 
chips, since those no longer produce the flawed voltage offset, meaning 
that there may be very little original signal avilable for modulation 
(depending on what other regular output the SID's voices are producing).

WebSid's digi-detection will report "D418" for respective songs.



Mahoney's "8-bit samples"

There is a more recent "turbo charged" variant of the $d418 approach that 
was first presented by Pex 'Mahoney' Tufvesson in 2014 (see
https://livet.se/mahoney/c64-files/Musik_RunStop_Technical_Details_by_Pex_Mahoney_Tufvesson_v2.pdf )
Here the trick is to carefully setup the regular voice output such that 
not only the volume but also different filter activation will influence 
the modulated result. Since both the volume as well as the filter 
activation are controlled via the D418 register, the approach still only 
requires one register-write (i.e. 4-clock cycles) to output a sample, 
i.e. it is extremely fast allowing for maximum sample rates.

Due to the fact that the "carrier signal" has been specifically set up,
the approach runs fine also on newer 8580 models.

A sample can now have more than 4-bits (though Mahoney's 8-bit claim 
is exaggerated and it is probably closer to 6-7 bits)

While being a technically impressive trick, the disadvantage of this 
approach is that the SID's 3 voices are completely dedicated to the
task so that 3 voices are needed to play 1 digi-track. 

WebSid's digi-detection will report "M418" for respective songs.



2) frequency modulation based

This technique probably produces the highest-quality sample playback, 
allowing for actual 8-bit samples.

The underlying principle is to use one of the waveforms that linearly 
transition from 0x0 to 0xfff (i.e sawtooth or triangle), to start it at 0 
and then let it go up for a fixed number of clock cycles until it has 
reached the desired output level and then output that level for the 
duration of a sample. 

The sample playback rate of this type of player is fixed, e.g. the 
player might play a new sample every 129 cycles. This means the SID 
will *always* "step up" the waveform output for *exactly* 129 cycles 
and it is then just a matter of finding suitable frequency settings 
that will result in the desired output levels after 129 clock cycles.

(see https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:vicious_sid_demo_routine_explained )

In addition to the high sample resolution, an advantage of this approach 
is that the resulting output can still be routed through the SID's filter.
Also it only requires one voice and the SID's other 2 voices can still
be used for something else.

Disadvantages of the approach are its precise timing requirements and the 
relatively slow execution speed (in the order of 20 clock cycles to 
perform the various SID register writes). This results in typical output
sample rates around 20kHz.

	example songs: LMan - Vortex.sid, Vicious_SID_2-15638Hz.sid, Soundcheck.sid

WebSid's digi-detection will report "FM" for respective songs.



3) pulse waveform based

An early/primitive form of pulse-waveform based sample output can be 
found in Slapshot_1987.sid. Here a 7kHz 1-bit signal is generated by 
manually turning the test-bit on/off and thereby toggling betweeen 
the 0x0 and 0xfff output level. Obviously the respective result 
leaves a lot to be desired and the fact that the timing is badly 
off as well just adds insult to injury..


More sophisticated later players use what might be be called a
"pulse width modulation" approach. (WebSid's digi-detection will 
report "PWM" for respective songs.)

Their principle is to use a high frequency pulse-waveform and then 
manipulate the "average" output signal by shifting the pulse-width
one way or another to get any average level between 0x0 and 0xfff.

Computationally, respective players are similarly expensive as the 
above "FM" players - since the waveform's test-bit, as well as the 
pulse-width have to be updated for every output sample.

As with the "FM" approach the resulting output can still be routed
through the SID's filter.

But the big disadvantage is that respective songs tend to create 
a very annoying high-pitched carrier signal. (And most emulators
seem to make things even worse.)

	example songs: Voodoo_People_part_1.sid, Wonderland_IX_part_5.sid, 
					Wonderland_XII-Digi_part_1.sid


					
4) waveform toggling based

Finally there is an approach that tries to let one voice create 
different output levels by toggling between different waveforms. The 
respective frequency and pulse-width settings of that voice are 
previously configured in such a way that the respective waveforms 
result in the desired output levels.

The advantage of the approach is its fast execution speed: similar 
to the $d418 approach only one register write is needed for each 
sample. The other two voices can still be used for regular output 
without any interference from the digi-output and the result can 
still be routed through the SID's filter.

The disadvantage is that the effective sample resolution may be lacking.

	examples: Ice_Guys.sid (2-bit samples), Wonderland_XIII_tune_1.sid


	
	
There are songs that switch between the above techniques.
	examples: Storebror.sid
	
or use a voice specific technique on multiple voices:
	examples: Super_Carling_the_Spider_credits.sid

WebSid specifics
----------------

WebSid uses specific detection logic to recognize the most commonly
used digi-approaches. The main purpose is to allow a respective 
distinction between "regular" voice-output and digi-shenanigans in
the emulation's "scope view" output visualizations and playback status.
	
In addition WebSid may use respective digi information to get rid
of unpleasant high pitched hissing noises that some approaches might 
be normally plagued by (respective songs may sound better in WebSid 
than they ever would in the real world.. sorry about that).
