// When looking at real-HW recordings of pulse-wave based songs (e.g. see Superman-Man_of_Steel.sid) 
// I noticed characteristic distortions like those caused by single-time-constant high-pass filters (see 
// https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/static/companion.websites/9780199339136/Appendices/Appendix_E.pdf
// - figure E.14 ) an effect that my emulator so far had not reproduced at all.. While investigating the 
// origin of the effect I found that investigators at reSid had already identified the culprit as what they called the SID's "external filter".
// I don't know how accurate their analysis really is, but the additional low-/high-pass filter that they propose creates distortions that 
// are pretty much in line with what can be observed in the SOASC recordings. What they say sounds like a very plausible explanation and
// I therefore added the same kind of filter configuration here (thanks to the resid team for their impressive reverse-engineering efforts!).
