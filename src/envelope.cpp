/*
* This file contains everything to do with the emulation of the SID chip's
* envelope generator.
*
* Glossary: When talking about "frames" in the comments in this file, it means
* display frames (i.e. 50 or 60Hz screen refresh interval) as a measurement unit
* for elapsed time. (Tracker-musicians may also use "frame" for the "rows" in
* their tracker - but a row will only correspond to a display-frame in 1x speed
* songs whereas higher speed songs will play multiple rows per frame.)
*
* In the predictive implementation of the old emulator version, dealing with
* the ADSR-delay bug was an error prone nightmare. With the transition to a
* cycle-by-cycle emulation luckily all those problems vanished.
*
* Credits:

*    this includes the findings of the reSid team.

/*
Notes regarding ADSR-bug:

The basic setup is this: There is a 15-bit LFSR that "increments" with each
cycle and eventually overflows. The user specified "attack", "decay" and
"release" settings translate into respective reference thresholds. The threshold
of the active phase (e.g. attack) is compared against the current LFSR and
in case there is an *exact* match, then the envelope counter is updated (i.e.
increased or decreased once) and the LFSR is reset to 0 (other than the
automatic overflow, this is the *only* way the LFSR can ever be reset to 0).
 
One important aspect is that "counting and comparing" *never* stops - i.e. even
when some goal has been achieved (e.g. "sustain" level for "decay" phase or 0
for "release" phase). There is no such thing as an idle mode and either the
"attack", "decay" or "release" counter is always active (e.g. the "release"
threshold stays active until the phase is manually switched to a new "attack"
by setting the GATE bit).

The ADSR-bug may be encountered whenever the currently active threshold is
manually changed to a *lower* value (e.g. by setting the AD or SR registers for
an active phase or by changing the GATE and thereby replacing the currently used
threshold): Whenever the new threshold is already lower than the current LFSR
content then the bug occurs: In order to reach the threshold the LFSR has to
first overflow and go "full cicle". In the worst case that amounts to 32k clock
ticks, i.e. 32ms by which the selected phase is delayed.


test-cases
----------
Confusion_2015_Remix.sid: updates threshold then switches to lower threshold via GATE
Trick'n'Treat.sid: horrible "shhhht-shhht" sounds when wrong/hacked handling..
K9_V_Orange_Main_Sequence.sid: creates "blips" when wrong/hacked handling
$11_Heaven.sid: creates audible clicks whem wrong/hacked handling
Eskimonika.sid: good test for false potitives
Monofail.sid
Blade_Runner_Main_Titles_2SID.sid
Move_Me_Like_A_Movie.sid: creates "false positives" that lead to muted voices
Macrocosm.sid  missing "base instrument" in voice 3 (20secs ff)


Note: the maximum ADSR-bug-condition duration is about 32k cycles/1.7 frames
long, i.e. there are players that explicitily trigger the bug 2 frames in
advance so they can then safely (without bug) start some new note 2 frames later.
