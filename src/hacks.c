* Mahoney's Storebror.sid is a good example of a song that is actually a complete demo program with graphix and all.
* Different sections of the tune are syncronized to the timing of the different demo parts - which unfortunately 
* use about every timing trick in the book and then some. Unfortunately the emu lacks the precision needed to 
* accurately emulate the song.. without the below hack, some of the song phases are unaligned, e.g. the 
* "singing" clashes with the bells, etc .. the hack just disabled the "difficult" part so that the 
* remaining (i.e. non-singing) parts work nicely..
