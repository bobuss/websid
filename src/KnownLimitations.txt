KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

SID related: 

- Filter implementation based on Hermit's jssid.js may not be 100% acurate (this is probably
  the prio 1 limitation)
- the combined-waveforms generated based on Hermit's approach may deviate from respective 
  tables recorded on the real hardware
- output is calculated only once per sample (which typically covers a 22 system clock
  cycle interval). The random value picked may differ from the average value that
  would result when considering the output at every single cycle.
  
VIC related:

- the timing delays caused by the use of sprites are NOT considered at all: songs that
  heavily rely on respective effects for their correct timing will not work correctly
  (examples: Vicious_SID_2-15638Hz.sid plays too fast, Comaland_tune_3.sid & Fantasmolytic_tune_2.sid
  are badly out of sync, .. there will be others)
  
ROM related: 
  
  The Commodore 64 ROM images are still copyrighted material and in order to use them a license 
  is required from the current copyright owner. I am aware that other emulators just use them under
  the assumption that since nobody has complained so far it might be OK to just use them. But given 
  the facts that only a small fraction of songs would actually benefit from the ROM images I decided to 
  completely do without them:

- the emulator does NOT contain any BASIC ROM nor CHAR ROM. This means that BASIC programs
  will not work at all. And songs that actually try us use the character ROM will not work correctly 
  either (I am aware of exactely one such song: Acid_Flashback.sid).
  
- there is a minimal set of KERNAL ROM function replacements but not a complete ROM image. Problems 
  may occur if a song tries to use unusual functionalities that are not yet covered or if it has 
  specific timing requirements that would only be met by the original ROM implementation.
