KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------

SID related: 
- Filter implementation based on Hermit's jssid.js may not be 100% acurate (this is probably
  the prio 1 limitation)
- the combined-waveforms generated based on Hermit's approach may deviate from respective 
  tables recorded on the real hardware
- output is calculated only once per sample (which typically covers a 22 system clock
  cycle interval). The random value picked may differ from the average value that
  would result when considering the output at every single cycle.
  
VIC related:
- the timing delays caused by the use of sprites are NOT considered at all: songs that
  heavily rely on respective effects for their correct timing will not work correctly
  (examples: Vicious_SID_2-15638Hz.sid plays too fast, Comaland_tune_3.sid & Fantasmolytic_tune_2.sid
  are badly out of sync, .. there will be others)
