/*
* Performance optimization only.
*
* This violates the normal encapsulation of the "memory" impl for the 
* purpose of slightly faster access in timing critical logic.
*
* It should not normally be used and the same functionality is available
* via the regular memReadIO and memWriteIO API.
* 
* Rationale: For very small functions (e.g. getters) the overhead involved
* in a function call seems to be significant as compared to the run time
* of the actual functionality. In this context here, the problem may be somewhat
* WebAssemby specific: C normally provides the "inline" directive however
* for some reason code seems to break completely when it is used for WebAssembly
* compilation (i.e. "inline" cannot be used here). Also function call overhead
* may be higher than usual: It might be a contributing factor that some 
* WebAssembly engines seem to perform stack consistency checks before every
* function call. I similarly replaced respective small functions that are 
* critical during single-cycle-clocking in other parts of the implementation 
* (see cia and cpu). Whithout and functional changes this refactoring
* alone lead to a decrease of run time by 10%.
